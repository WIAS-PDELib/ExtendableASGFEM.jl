# Stochastic Coefficients

Stochastic coefficients play a central role in uncertainty quantification and stochastic finite element methods. In this package, coefficients are represented using a Karhunen-Loève expansion (KLE), which allows for the efficient representation of random fields with prescribed covariance structure.

## Overview

The Karhunen-Loève expansion expresses a stochastic process as a series of orthogonal functions weighted by uncorrelated random variables:

$$
    a(x, \omega) = a_0(x) + \sum_{n=1}^N \sqrt{\lambda_n} \phi_n(x) \xi_n(\omega)
$$

where $a_0(x)$ is the mean, $\lambda_n$ and $\phi_n(x)$ are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the covariance operator, and $\xi_n$ are independent standard normal random variables.
