# ONBasis

An ONBasis (=orthonormal basis) stores information for the orthogonal polynomials
of the disctribution, like norms, quadrature rules and cached evaluations at quadrature points.
It is the main building brick for the tensorized basis associated to the multi-indices
of the stochastic discretization.
